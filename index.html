The company headquarters is situated at Thrissur,Kerala, India.I am currently an intern at Eallisto from August 2018. We are assigned weekly tasks which we have to complete on time.
<br>
The tasks are as follows</p>
<h3 class="Task">Task 1:HTML and CSS</h3>
<p class="about"> The first task was to understand and learn HTML and CSS from <span class="dropdown"><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools</a><div class="dropdown-content">w3schools.com</div></span>.<span class="about"> Not being a computer science student from higher secondary, it was diificult to understand at first, but later on, the bliss of getting things correct, made me crave for more. The only source of knowledge and guidance for this task was <span class="dropdown"><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools</a><div class="dropdown-content">w3schools.com</div></span> and</span><span class="about"> <span class="dropdown"><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a><div class="dropdown-content">wiki</div></span>.</span><div class="about">For more details <span class="dropdown"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tvgYBYaFlCuHxDa2WxAoqRG6wLDPPWmQ" style="text-decoration:underline;">Click Here</a>

<h3 class="Task">Task 2:UBUNTU</h3>
<p class="about">The second weeks task was to familiarise UBUNTU in a virtual environment. Iinstalled VMWare Workstation, in which I ran the latest version of UBUNTU. The task had to test the basic commands in UBUNTU like pwd,cd,less,nano etc. Again the lack of knowledge in computer programming was a huge hindrance at beginning, but thanks to the video tutorials of all the commands in youtube, I not only tested the basic commands, but also got an overview of what they are used for. To the end of texting the commands I faced an issue where UBUNTU started to reinstall, thus making the process even more difficult. My friends in CSE Department, gave an idea of the pending work in the task. After reinstalling UBUNTU I completed the pending work with the knowledge I got from my peers and tutorial videos.<div class="about">For more details <span class="dropdown"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-Give26AxSXpHTG6H0XMirLraDJOZHUc" style="text-decoration:underline;">Click Here</a>

<h3 class="Task"> Task 3:GitHub</h3>
<p class="about"> The third weeks task led to the creation of this website. Currently having knowledge in HTML and CSS, I was successful to creat a website of my own. Knowledge from my peers, <span class="dropdown"><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a><div class="dropdown-content">github pages</div></span><span class="about"> and Video tutorials have helped in the successful completion of this task.</span><div class="about">For more details <span class="dropdown"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=112bF0dEjfq49KEGNZdJLF_okzYR1-vNB" style="text-decoration:underline;">Click Here</a>

<h3 class="NEWS">Kerala-The Land hurt with water</h3> 
<p class="kerala"> Kerala, known for its backwaters, got to experience the helpless feel of being surrounded by waters. Though Kerala on the whole, is known for backwaters, Alappuzha and Kottayam are the districts having all the scenery and as well suffered the risk of floods always. Being a native of Alappuzha, floods weren’t new to me, but for those on the high grounds, cities and places where there weren’t any risk of floods were absolutely stunned this time. Rivers took new paths which were residential areas, thus leading to unimaginable devastation. The currents were so high that very few houses have survived the floods. People were at first amused with water reaching their grounds. It took only hours for that amusement to change to fear and helplessness. Waters started flowing in the height of double storeyed buildings and many were stuck at their terraces in heavy rain without food and water, ironically surrounded by water. By the time, I had realized that the situations are worse, time was past actions. I stayed back at my college hostel to escape from the floods that my place was facing. At hostel, I did all I could to help the needy by making donations and passing on the messages of the needy to the authorities. I have the huge satisfaction of being a part of, or way for a family to be rescued who was stuck at a roof top without food and water for three days. Though small, I was content with the fact that my donations were enough for a person to survive.</p>

<div class="kerala">The people in distress made me want to have a superpower of flying and enough strength to carry people as I fly, or even better to stop water itself, or rains for the time being. Being mortal beings, I know it is impossible, but it is the nature of human beings to wish for superpowers in times of distress and disaster.</div>
<br>
<p class="kerala"> The government took immediate action in this regard, which held a major role in reducing the casualties upto an extend. But we have to think of those who lost their lives in this. They were misfortunate enough to get caught in the currents or being weak to survive the crisis. It says <q>Prevention is better than cure</q>, and I would suggest had the government known of the oncoming disaster they should have been more careful, but yes, no man could stop the rivers from taking its new paths, and no man could predict it. So the blame is not upon not predicting this, but on the uncontrolled developmental activites that has led to this disaster. The largest flood that Kerala has seen was in 1924 (or known by flood of 99[Malayalam calendar]). There are people who have sent hose floods, and they have testified, that event though 1924 flood was the largest, water then did not rise in the areas in which water level rose this time. So I think the thought process should be done, and each and everyone of us, especially the authorities who knows the aftermath, hold the sole responsibility in this disaster. Man at times of distress, will lose all his greed and will realize how incapable he is in front of Mother Nature. This was indeed a wake up call for many, and an eye opener for those who thought that they had all the nature under control, and that nothing can happen to them. People started behaving more empathetically, which was clearly evident in the travel I did after the floods. Fishermen, the real heroes who rescued many were once treated with despise and disgust and are now treated with respect. Every help that Kerala received is to be praised and the initiatives taken to rebuild Kerala is indeed to refreshing sight.</p>
